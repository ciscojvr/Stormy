    // Because this closure will be executed after the function has been called, particularly since we're going to be returning the DataTask, holding onto these closures, and then calling resume at some other point, we need to mark these closures as @escaping.
    // We made JSON and DarkSkyError optional below because when we have valid JSON data to work with, presumably we won't have any error. Similarly, if something goes wrong, and we end up with an error, we won't have any valid JSON. So in a given situation its impossible to have values for both arguments. They are optional because when one has a value, the other can be nil and vice-versa.
