        // these methods are asyncrhonous
        // a completion handler is a closure that we define containing the logic of what we want to do after this request
        // has completed. It has no return type because when we write asynchronous code, because it happens in the background,
        // we cannot contorl when our code is executed. The closure doesn't give us a data object back because its not going to
        // to finish right now
        // A closure can capture references to all the object we need and execute the logic at a later time. Closures used
        // in this way are called callbacks.The dataTask is executed, and then when it is done, it calls back to our closure
        // and executes the body.
        // We can implement the same kind of behavior by using the delegate pattern. An object can complete the task ,and when its done it can inform or call back to the delegate. The delegate then performs fruther actions with whateer data is returned.
