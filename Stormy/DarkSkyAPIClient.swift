Force unwrapping okay here because if it doesn't work, if we have an incorrect URL, we want it to crash because we want to capture this early on we don't want the app to just stay inactive because our base URL, the thing that handles all the networks calls, is incorrect.

Since this closure is also executed after the body of this function is executed, we need to specify that this completion closure is escaping. We can't have both arguments (CurentWeather and DarkSkyError) containing non-nil values at any given point so we need to make them both optional.
